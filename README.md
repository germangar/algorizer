For que required modules:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Take a look inside example_misc.py for getting an idea on how to work the scripts (I added a lot of explanatory comments) and run it to see how it works.

You can use template.py as base to create your own.


I'll add a proper readme with instructions and more example scripts in the future. I'm opening the repository but not adding any tags nor explanations yet.
